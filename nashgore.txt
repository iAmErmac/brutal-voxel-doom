//
// SPECIAL LUMP: BLUDTYPE
//
//===========================================================================

NashGore NEXT introduces a new special lump called BLUDTYPE. You can simply
create a BLUDTYPE.txt and load it after NGM; the lumps will stack.

For example: gzdoom.exe -file nashgore.pk3 bludtype.txt

The BLUDTYPE lump is used to list blood actor classes to override. For
example, Smooth Doom changes the Cacodemon blood type to "Blueblood", which
causes NGM's blood to never appear. To fix that, simply add "BlueBlood"
on a new line into BLUDTYPE.txt.

USAGE: Simply list down blood Actor classes you wish to override, each on a
new line.

A sample BLUDTYPE.txt for Smooth Doom:

XBlood
BlueBlood
GreenBlood

//===========================================================================
//
// KNOWN ISSUES/TO DO LIST
//
//===========================================================================

- Heretic Knight's axe spawns blood (A_DripBlood)
- Crushed/squishy gibs probably don't work correctly with crushing polyobjs
- Ice chunks might get stuck inside solid objects
- When frozen enemies automatically shatter, gibs will not appear
