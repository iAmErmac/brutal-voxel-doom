// CODE CHANGES
//
//===========================================================================

Some light ZScript support code was necessary to further enhance this mod.
Here's a list of what's added or changed from a coding perspective:

- Monsters will face the player upon death.
- Colorized blood for the Cacodemon, Baron of Hell and Hell Knight.
- Spectre's renderstyle has been forced to shadow as any other renderstyle
  appears to be very glitchy.
- Incorporated GZSprFix's (which, in turn, is based off Revenant100's Sprite
  Fix Project) actor fixes concerning wrongly-lit attacking frames. Affects
  the Zombieman, Cyberdemon, Spider Mastermind, Chaingunner and Arachnotron.
- Blood sprite has billboarding enforced.
- Some spherical voxels will always face the camera.
